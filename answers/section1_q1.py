"""
When β = 0, the choice probability is not affected by the value of the stimuli and always exactly at chance level.
When β = ∞, choices become completely deterministic and the subject always picks the option with the maximum value.
Mathematically:

p(A) = exp(0 . Va) / (exp(0 . Va) + exp(0 . Vb)) = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5

When β = 0, the values don't matter as they are multiplied by 0


When β = ∞,


So if VA >VB, even if this difference is tiny, then exp(∞ x VA))>> exp(∞ x VB), and so p(A)=1,
vice versa when VB > VA.
