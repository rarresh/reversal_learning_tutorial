The simplest option is to take the maximum (or peak) of the distribution. This
is what we call the __maximum likelihood estimate__. However, this ML estimate
disregards the fact that we have more information about the estimated parameter.

A usually more reliable and stable estimate is the mean of the distribution, or
the value of each bin multiplied with the probability of that value. This is
called the __expected value__ (EV).
